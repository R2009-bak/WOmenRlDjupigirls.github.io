    <p>You are a school student now, so if you want to be a part of something big, you should start thinking and planning your future. Universities often search for uniqueness in your application and how you have influenced your community by launching projects. For example, you can start anti-plastic usage action in order to cut the number of plastic being thrown into oceans and the environment. Also, you can volunteer and help plant trees which would have a huge benefit on local ecology, since trees are the source of extra oxygen. Or you can start a project on how humanity could cleanse polluted water. For example, recently people have come up with an idea of using air sending tubes in order to cleanse deep waters from garbage. And the project has succeeded. You can make innovative ways to solve global problems and impact on our world to improve its security and comfort for humanity.</p>
